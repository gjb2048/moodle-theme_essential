{"name":"Moodle-theme essential","tagline":"Bootstrap based Moodle Theme","body":"The \"Essential\" Moodle Theme\r\n======================\r\n\r\nWith 2.5 now released Julian thought it time to take the opportunity to build a new theme that would push the new theme engine to it's limits a bit. With that in mind he introduced the new \"Essential\" theme. Now Julian has left us for Canvassian adventures, Gareth and David have taken over development and maintenance of this theme.\r\nThe idea of this theme is to make the site look as little like Moodle as possible. In this specific instance, it would be used on sites where Moodle would potentially serve as a company homepage rather than just a course list.\r\n\r\nCool things to know about the theme.\r\n - It attempts to load as many as possible icons from a font\r\n - Most of what you think are \"graphics\" are actually the [Awesome font](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)\r\n - The slider on the frontpage of the demo site is completely customisable through theme settings\r\n - I am really trying to push what [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) Grids can do. As such the theme is fully responsive.\r\n - The footer is all custom Moodle regions. This means blocks can be added. The footer of the demo site is full of HTML blocks in this instance\r\n - The Theme uses [Google web fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) to give it that extra bit of shazam!\r\n - Social Network icons appear at the top of the page dynamically based on theme settings\r\n - The entire colour scheme can be modified with theme settings\r\n - The homepage main area is just a label. The theme will ship with custom classes that you can set for tables and links to modify their formatting. No knowledge of code is needed as you can use the text editor to do this. Documentation will be provided outlining what the additional classes are.\r\n\r\nOriginal Author\r\n===============\r\nJulian Ridden\r\nMoodle profile: https://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=39680\r\nWeb profile:    http://au.linkedin.com/in/eduridden/\r\n\r\nMaintained by\r\n=============\r\nDavid Bezemer\r\nMoodle profile | https://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=1416592\r\nWeb profile | http://www.davidbezemer.nl\r\n\r\nG J Barnard MSc.

PGCE.\r\nMoodle profile | http://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=442195\r\nWeb profile | http://about.me/gjbarnard\r\n\r\nRequired version of Moodle\r\n==========================\r\nThis version works with Moodle version 2013111800 release 2.6 (Build: 20131118) and above within the 2.6 branch until the\r\nnext release.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on\r\n'docs.moodle.org/26/en/Installing_Moodle'.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of our control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Copy the extracted 'essential' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 5. Select as the theme for the site.\r\n 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUpgrading\r\n=========\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of our control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Make a backup of your old 'essential' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.\r\n 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'essential' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'\r\n    under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.\r\n 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n==============\r\n 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.\r\n 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'essential'.\r\n 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nDowngrading\r\n===========\r\nIf for any reason you wish to downgrade to a previous version of the theme (unsupported) then this procedure will inform you of how to\r\ndo so:\r\n1.  Ensure that you have a copy of the existing and older replacement theme files.\r\n2.  Put Moodle into 'Maintenance mode' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Server -> Maintenance mode', so that there\r\n    are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n3.  Switch to a core theme, 'Clean' for example, under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes ->\r\n    Theme selector -> Default'.\r\n4.  In '/theme/' remove the folder 'essential' i.e. ALL of the contents - this is VITAL.\r\n5.  Put in the replacement 'essential' folder into '/theme/'.\r\n6.  In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'theme_essential' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table, then\r\n    in the 'config' table find the 'name' with the value 'allversionhash' and clear its 'value' field.  Perform a 'Purge all caches'\r\n    under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.\r\n7.  Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to\r\n    'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.\r\n8.  Switch the theme back to 'Essential' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes -> Theme selector ->\r\n    Default'.\r\n9.  Put Moodle out of 'Maintenance mode' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Server -> Maintenance mode'.\r\n\r\nReporting issues\r\n================\r\nBefore reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential\r\nthat you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core\r\nfunctionality that is out of its control.\r\n\r\nWhen reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')\r\nor check the issue list https://github.com/DBezemer/moodle-theme_essential/issues and if the problem does not exist, create an\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's \r\n'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot\r\ncan be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.\r\n\r\nNew in 2.7.7\r\n============\r\n- FIX: Issue #173: Message menu shows wrong time difference in Russian.\r\n- FIX: Issue #175: Gradebook several bugs.\r\n- FIX: Issue #179: User picture error.\r\n- FIX: Issue #189: Gradebook - column text and sorting doesn't fit the column.\r\n- FIX: Issue #191: Blocks not showing on the right of the frontpage for non-admins.\r\n- FIX: Issue #196: Gradebook - vertical size in fixed column view.\r\n- FIX: Issue #200: Category Edit / Delete Missing in newest version of Essential.\r\n- FIX: Issue #208: Bug: Undefined function is_loggedin().\r\n- FIX: Issue #209: Showing white background.\r\n- FIX: Issue #211: Image size in message menu.\r\n- FIX: Issue #220: Standard Moodle Chat interface fails to load.\r\n- FIX: Issue #221: Missing string 'unreadnewnotification'.\r\n- FIX: Issue #225: Blank pages after some times.\r\n- FIX: Issue #228: Incorrect z-index in menu.\r\n- FIX: Issue #233: User image wrong in IE.\r\n- FIX: Issue #237: Homepage main content block layout issues.\r\n- FIX: Issue #238: Logged in user block styling.\r\n- FIX: Issue #241: Background image appears as text box background.\r\n- FIX: Issue #243: View Full toggle button not functional 2.6.9b.\r\n- FIX: Issue #246: Menu bar down arrow caret causes shift of menu.\r\n- NEW: Issue #74 : Fonts are CDN only.\r\n- NEW: Issue #139: Enter own CDN font names.\r\n- NEW: Issue #149: Add setting to not show the site shortname.\r\n- NEW: Issue #170: Option in settings to choose how the site title in header appears.\r\n- NEW: Issue #176: Option to Hide Calendar, Private Files, Forum Posts and Discussions from Dropdown.\r\n- NEW: Issue #178: Error when editing user preferences.\r\n- NEW: Issue #180: Same height marketing spots.\r\n- NEW: Issue #181: Marketing spot header same as navbar.\r\n- NEW: Issue #185: Custom background image dimensions.\r\n- NEW: Issue #186: Add edit links to custom frontpage content items.\r\n- NEW: Issue #197: Gradebook overall average font colour.\r\n- NEW: Issue #204: Windows Mobile Apps.\r\n- NEW: Issue #212: Upgrade FontAwesome 4.2.0.\r\n- NEW: Issue #223: How to make a sub menu from custom menu.\r\n- NEW: Issue #226: Move slideshow slides loading to function in lib.php.\r\n- NEW: Issue #235: Color of course navigation block.\r\n- NEW: Issue #240: Header title not wrapping in mobile view.\r\n\r\nNew in 2.7.6b\r\n=============\r\n- FIX: Issue #205: Has the eye icon used to Enable/Disable an element been reversed in functionality?\r\n- FIX: Issue #207: Fixed solution for #175 #196 - thanks @ppv1979.\r\n- FIX: main site regions clean-up to prevent issues with blocks.\r\n- FIX: huge code rewrite for menu items.\r\n- FIX: optimized more icons to be loaded from font.\r\n- NEW: New loading gif, reducing size by 500%.\r\n- NEW: Issue #198: Collapsed Topics and other course formats (like core weeks) need print single page the same.\r\n       Course formats catered for: Topics, Weeks, Collapsed Topics, Columns, Grid and Noticeboard.
